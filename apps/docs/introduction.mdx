## Features

Here are some of the features that BuildIt offers:

## Motivation

OrbitKit was born out of the need for a new type of starterkits, ones that are "headless" and are more scalable meaning, no UI templates, no pre-built landing page, just the core primitives, services and tools you need configured together.

On top of that, it's a monorepo, because sooner or later you will transition to a monorepo (god forbid you pick multi-repo) so why not start with one from the beginning?

## What you get

On the surface, it's pretty easy to see what you get with OrbitKit, but let's break it down:

1. Next.js product web application
2. Astrojs marketing website
3. Mintlify docs website

These are the three core parts of any big project we believe, a product, a marketing website, and documentation. With OrbitKit, you get all three, and they all consume packages from the monorepo so you end up sharing code between them really easily.

## Expectations

You should expect a learning curve with OrbitKit if you haven't worked in monorepos before or with the tools we use. But we believe that the learning curve is worth it, and we are here to help you through it with our documentation and github issues.

This starterkit is not intended for beginners, but for those who are looking for a starterkit that can take their startup idea into the real world faster than normal with your added expertise in building your product.

In simple terms, you should have experience in using React, Next.js and TypeScript. We believe if you know these three, you can pick up the rest quite easily.

## Sponsors

This project was born out of my love for open source, monorepos and DX (developer experience). A project in such a scale requires a lot of time and effort to maintain.

If OrbitKit will be useful to you, please consider [❤️ sponsoring me on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/ixahmedxi) so that I can continue to maintain and improve it. I appreciate your support!
